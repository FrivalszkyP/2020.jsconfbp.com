    <p>
      2020 will be the 5th time, when we're running our Scholarship Program!
      As every year so far, we'll provide a limited number of free,
      Scholarship tickets to help underrepresented groups in tech to attend
      the conference.
    </p>

    <h2 >Who can apply for a scholarship?</h2>

    <p>
      Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for a
      scholarship.
    </p>

    <p>
      This includes but isn’t limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+
      people, disabled people and people facing economic or social hardships.
      We would like to give them a chance.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is this good?</h2>

    <p>
      Scholarship Support is not money for a party, nor for fancy catering, or
      a nice booth.
    </p>

    <p>It is a chance for someone.</p>

    <p>
      We try to reach as much people as possible, in the community around the
      region, and we are working hard, to make this event available for
      everyone who is interested. But we know there are many in the region who
      would, but cannot attend such a conference, for various reasons. They
      can get a ticket to the conference, through application.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a chance for them, to meet people they can learn from, see talks
      they can benefit from, a chance to step forward
    </p>

    <p>
      A chance for you to help someone in a great way for a reasonable price.
    </p>

    <p>
      The past years, after we started this program, we've{' '}

        actually changed someone's life for good
      </a>
      ! Imagine what is possible by helping with even more people!
    </p>

    <h2 className={ getClassName({ color: 'orange', side: 'right'}) }>How does the scholarship awarding works?</h2>

    <p>
      All applicants for the Scholarship Program has to go through an
      application procedure. Along with personal details for the tickets
      itself, we ask applicants a few questions about what they do in tech, or
      what they wish to learn on the event. These answers are helpful for the
      jury, who will evaluate the applications and award the tickets.
    </p>

    <p>
      We, the organizers, do not take part in the jury process. Last years we
      asked Green Fox Academy in Budapest to help us evaluate the applications
      and select the awardees. To manage the scholarship fund, we turned to
      the Asimov Foundation in Budapest, who helped the selected people with
      travel arrangements if necessary. This year, we plan to cooperate with
      these organisations again.

    <h2 >Where is the Scholarship Budget coming from?</h2>

    <p>
      The budget is filled by generous donors, both from the Attendees and our
      Sponsors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attendees can sponsor the program with buying Supported tickets. Both
      Early Bird and Regular tickets are available in a Scholarship Supporting
      variant. This means, that the ticket price includes a percent of a
      supported ticket, that will be given to someone in need.
    </p>

    <p>Let's see this ticket for example:</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Regular JS Ticket + 50% Scholarship Support = €466</strong>
      <br />
      235 EUR + 117 EUR + VAT + Fees
    </p>

    <p>
      This means, if you buy this ticket, you'll sponsor half of someone's
      ticket, who otherwise could not afford it.
    </p>

    <p>We've set several levels of sponsorship: 25%, 50% and 75%.</p>

    <p>
      10% of every Sponsor package goes directly into the Scholarship Budget.
      So all of our sponsors become donors to the Program. If your company is
      interested in participating, check out our{' '}
