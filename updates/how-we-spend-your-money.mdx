As we move on to our 2020 edition, we feel important to let our attendees know, how we spend all the money we receive from
tickets and sponsors. So we‚Äôve decided to compile a transparency report for everyone on the costs and incomes of
JSConf Budapest 2019 and CSSConf Budapest 2019. This post can be useful for you, if you're curious about our ticket pricing,
or plan to run an event or conference in the future.

We're a nonprofit event, which means that us, the organizers and volunteers, don't get paid for the work we put into
JSConf Budapest and CSSConf Budapest each year. We aim to spend every money on the conferences, to provide a better
experience for the attendees.

Small note on being nonprofit: the legal entity behind the event, _JSSC Kft_ is a for-profit company.
It runs other events beside JSConf and CSSConf Budapest, but keeps these projects financially separated from each other.
As JSConf and CSSConf is dedicated to be nonprofit event, we can be totally transparent of the budget for these events.

In 2020 we plan to achieve at least the same or better experience for everyone
who participates in JSConf Budapest 2020, with the same ticket prices.


## Income

In 2019 we‚Äôve received **‚Ç¨181.368** from 2 sources, tickets and sponsorship.

Looking at this number, this is a tremendous amount of money for us to think of, and we feel honored for the support of the community and partner companies.

üòç**Thank you!** üíñ

## Taxes

Don't imagine that we sit on this amount of money and pay everything at the end of the conferences. To optimize our budget and taxes,
we try to spend every cent we earn in each month. This doesn't mean we try to avoid, or trick with taxes: the tax on the tickets
and the tax on our expenses roughly balance each other out, so we pay most taxes through the services of our contractors.

## Expenses

We‚Äôre proud that we can pay the travel and stay of our speakers and MCs, beside the basic expenses
like venue, catering, tech setup, prints and lots of minor expenses.

In 2019 we‚Äôve spent **‚Ç¨184.250** on CSSConf Budapest and JSConf Budapest. These expenses are split by percentage like this:
