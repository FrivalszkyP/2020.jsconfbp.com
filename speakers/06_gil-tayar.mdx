  Yes, they’re here. Node v13.2.0 marked the first version of Node.JS where ESM support is unflagged,
  meaning you can start using ES Modules. It’s been a long, four year journey from defining them in the
  spec (June 2015!) till they could be used in Node.JS (November 2019).

  Why did it take so long? What were the major hurdles? Should we migrate? How does the migration path look like?
  Are they really better than CommonJS Modules? What is in store for the future?
</p>

  Gil Tayar, a former member of the Node.JS Modules Working Group, and now just a passionate observer of it,
  will try and navigate these confusing waters, and hopefully make you understand why, when,
  and how to migrate your Node.JS code to use ES Modules.

  30 years of experience have not dulled the fascination Gil Tayar has with software development. His passion is distributed systems and figuring out how to scale development to big teams. Extreme modularity and testing are the main tools in his toolbelt, using them to combat the code spaghetti monster at companies like Wix, Applitools, and at his current job as software architect at Roundforest.

  In his private life, he is a dad to two lovely kids (and a cat), an avid reader of Science Fiction, (he counts Samuel Delany, Robert Silverberg, and Robert Heinlein as favorites) and a passionate film buff. (Stanley Kubrick, Lars Von Trier, David Cronenberg, anybody?)

  Unfortunately for him, he hasn’t answered the big question of his life—what’s better, static or dynamic languages? But he’s working on it.
