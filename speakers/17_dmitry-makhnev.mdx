  Error handling is an extremely hard part of every JavaScript project that can produce a lot of bugs. Usually,
  developers use just the try/catch as a standard approach for the error handling, which is not so ideal solution
  because this statement catches anything which was thrown by the “throw” statement, as results developer:
</p>

- need extra conditions for handling restricted classes of exceptions;
- should rethrow errors or it can be eaten up;
- can’t separate errors and exceptions;

<p>
  In this talk, you’ll learn how to implement safe error handling (without mentioned problems) in a project
  and with perks like typed errors inside handlers, errors documentation of functions/methods without JSDoc and comments,
  and the ability to log your errors without a break of the error handling flow.
