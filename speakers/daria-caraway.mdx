<p>
  Have you ever come across a TypeScript type that made you go “nope” and close the file? Have you ever seen a type
  definition that had so many generic letters and nested statements, it felt utterly incomprehensible? In this talk,
  I will break down and decode some of the most perplexing TypeScript type definitions I have found in real life.
  You will learn how to make sense of these complex types and the TypeScript building blocks that compose them.
