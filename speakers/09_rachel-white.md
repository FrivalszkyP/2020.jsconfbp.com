  No server configuration? No problem! With serverless & JAMStack becoming more and more popular, it’s like static sites never went out of fashion. Though, unlike the 90s, we don’t have to sacrifice style for performance. Let’s recreate a Japanese style photo booth with React & WebAssembly, and get some insight into how our users are interacting with our site so we know how to make improvements on future versions.
