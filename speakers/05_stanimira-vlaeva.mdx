<p>
  Developers are paid to build features and not to update to the latest version of your library. That's especially true if thousands of developers working on business-critical products are using your UI components. Nevertheless, over the course of an year, we rewrote these same components from scratch.
</p>
<p>
  In this talk, I'll share how we created an ESLint plugin to boost the adoption of our new component library. You'll learn how to write your own ESLint rules, how to provide automated migrations and how to apply them to both TypeScript and HTML code."
