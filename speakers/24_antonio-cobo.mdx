  Have you ever compared yourself with other team members and felt like a fraud? Have you ever felt
  unworthy of your job promotion? Have you ever doubted of your successes? Do you know someone who
  could have answered “Yes” to any of those questions?

  These are symptoms of Impostor Syndrome; it affects most of the people working in IT. It affects conference speakers as well.
  I will share with you my with struggles public speaking and how I fight impostor syndrome on every conference.
